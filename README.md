## Abstract
Android is the most used mobile operating system. Therefore, the pupils studying Opera-
ting Systems subject should be able to understand how Android works from the inside and
also provide them a work environment to work with Android.

The aim of this project is to try to adapt the Operating Systems subject by creating a
virtual lab with all the necessary tools for working with the Android source code and
implementing some improvements to this lab. Some tools are analyzed and a comparative
study is done in order to determine what is the best tool that adapts better to the needs
of this project. Moreover, some lab tasks are implemented so that the students can work
on different parts of the Android kernel.
